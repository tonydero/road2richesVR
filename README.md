# road2richesVR for PC
Manage the Elite Dangerous Road to Riches while in VR

## Background
The road to riches is a way to make money in exploration in Elite Dangerous. A route is generated by one of the web tools, e.g. [https://www.spansh.co.uk/riches], and the Commander follows the route, scanning the high value systems suggested.

## Problem
In VR this requires peeking under your HMD to find the web page, copying the next system, then using the keyboard to paste it into the ED: Galaxy Map search field.

## Solution
This solution requires a CSV file containing the route to be downloaded to your PC. Every time the script is executed it finds the next system to be visited from the file, copies the system name to the clipboard and marks the system as done. On the next execution, the next system will be copied etc.

An iterator will persistant file-based state.

## Usage
`python <script location>\r2r.py <CSV file path>`

Then paste into Galaxy Map search box. 

The CSV file will now have the system pasted prefixed by `[x]` to indicate it has been checked off. Checked off systems are ignored on subsequent executions

## StreamDeck

Works well with a StreamDeck customisable button pad, e.g. [https://www.elgato.com/en/gaming/stream-deck-mini]

- create a multi action
  1. execute script, e.g. `python.exe C:\Users\Will\r2r.py C:\Users\Will\Downloads\r2r.csv`
  2. System Hotkey action. Name: Paste, HotkeyL Ctrl + V
  
Select the Galaxy Map search box in game, press the StreamDeck key.
